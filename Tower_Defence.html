                            For one of my school projects, I built a game using C#. The objective of the game was for players to place towers strategically in order to protect their army base. These towers were designed to attack soldiers who followed a specific path towards the player's base. As the game progressed, the soldiers became stronger and more difficult to defeat. To reinforce the strength of the towers, players could win points by eliminating soldiers, which could then be used to strengthen the towers.

                            This project was a great opportunity for me to showcase my skills in C# and game development, as well as demonstrate my understanding of object-oriented programming. The experience taught me a lot about how to create games C#, and I was able to improve my skills in moving objects, handling user input, and developing game mechanics. Moreover, the project also helped me learn how to approach complex problems and break them down into smaller, manageable parts.
