                            As a software developer, I realized the importance of having an online version of my professional resume that can easily be shared with potential employers and clients. Hence, I created this project, which serves as an online version of my CV, allowing visitors to view and download the latest version of my resume in PDF format.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To ensure that my CV is always up-to-date with my latest achievements and experiences, I used an API to convert my CV from HTML to PDF. This ensures that the PDF is always up-to-date with the latest changes made to my online CV.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This project has allowed me to enhance my knowledge and skills in PHP, particularly in working with async functions and writing, reading, and editing files. By developing an automated system that converts my online CV from HTML to PDF format using an API, I gained a deeper understanding of how to optimize file handling and processing in PHP. This experience has been invaluable to my growth as a developer, and I am excited to apply these skills to future projects.
