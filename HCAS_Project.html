                            During my third year internship, I had the opportunity to work as part of a development team in collaboration with a local hockey club. Together, we built an online platform designed to enhance the performance of the club's hockey players and provide coaches with tools to manage their players.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            My primary responsibility was to build the environment that allowed players to replay their matches and training sessions online. I was involved in building this feature in collaboration with SmartGoals B.V. They created a system that captured hockey trainings and matches using cameras installed above the hockey field and uploaded them to the cloud. My contribution to the project was developing a user-friendly web interface that allowed users to access and watch these videos easily.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In addition, I contributed building the platform's training environment, which allowed coaches to create and implement personalized training programs for their players. Developing a user-friendly interface was crucial to enable coaches to design training sessions and exercises that could be tailored to each player's individual needs.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Lastly, I helped build the user authentication and permissions system that allowed users to log in and access the platform based on their role as a trainer, player, administrator, or author. My responsibilities included ensuring that each user could access only the features and data relevant to their role.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Overall, I am proud to have played an integral role in building this online platform that provides hockey players and coaches with the tools they need to succeed. My contributions included building the core functionality of the platform, developing the interface for replaying trainings and matches, and building the training environment. This project is a great showcase of my skills and experience as a developer, and I am excited to include it in my portfolio.
